## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Stopping distance", fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(knitr)

cars %>% 
  summarise(mean_dist = mean(dist), 
                   sd_dist = sd(dist),
                   mean_speed = mean(speed),
                   sd_speed = sd(speed),
                   n = n()) %>% 
  kable()
```


```{r}
library(broom)

tidy(lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)) %>% 
  kable()
```
